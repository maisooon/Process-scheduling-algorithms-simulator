Scheduling algorithms schedule processes on the processor in an efficient and effective manner. This
scheduling is done by a Process Scheduler. It maximizes CPU utilization by increasing throughput.
Scheduling helps you think about what you want to achieve in a day, week or month, and it keeps you on 
track to accomplish your goals. and have 5 types :

1- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) 

2- Shortest Job first (SJF)

3- Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)

4- Round Robin (RR)

5- Priority Scheduling

______________


The purpose of a scheduling algorithm is to provide:

o Maximum CPU utilization

o Minimum turnaround time

o Fair allocation of CPU

o Maximum throughput

o Minimum waiting time

o Minimum response time
